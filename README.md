# Roguelike

Following the r/Roguelikedev tutorial line for python-libtcod in order to regain my grasp on python. Only got about half-way through due to schoolwork taking over my time, and my simple dislike for roguelikes.

It was fun though! Would definitely recommend the tutorial for any looking to learn roguelikes and / or python.
